      1. Variable name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($) or an underscore (_):
2. What you cannot start a variable name with: 
On no occasion should you begin a variable name with a number, period (.) and dash (-)

The keywords that mean specific things in Programming languages and wouldn't sit well in variable names (especially at the beginning)

 

3. You cannot use reserve words to name variables:
Keywords or reserved words are unique words that inform the programming language interpreter to perform a specific task. For instance, words like var are a keyword used in Javascript to declare variables. Search for more keywords on the web, so you are on the safe side.

 

4. Variable are case sensitive:
If you declare your variable as "score", you need to call it to score. You cannot reference that same variable with the capital Score. These are two different values. 

Now that you know that "score" and "Score" are two different values, it is terrible to create two variables with the same name by using other cases. Later on, it will confuse you, so don't use it, but rather combine words (like total_score).

 

5. Use variable names that describe the value:
It makes sense if you use the name computer understands, as I mentioned earlier. You, as the programmer, need to understand and remember what value to expect from the variable whenever you come across it in your code.

For example, to store a user's name, don't use "n"; instead, use "user_name", "first_name" or "last_name"

 

6. Use camelCase or snake_case in naming your variables:
If you have multiple words for your variables, use either camelcase or snake case to name your variables. For instance, use either "firstName" or "first_name" if you need to store the user's first name.
